# Swiftyboard

This is an iOS keyboard project that aims to reimplement all features from the native Apple keyboard, while remaining free and open-source.
Some of the features planned include spell-checking, neural-network based next word suggestions, swiping to type and voice dictation based on distilled huggingface speech recognition models.
